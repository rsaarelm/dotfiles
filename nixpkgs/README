Generate the home.nix symlink to the current host's nixfile ($(hostname).nix)
by running make. If the file is missing, make will complain.

New vimfiles that go in programs/neovim/ must be manually added to the list in
programs/neovim.nix.

# Local config

You can add non-versioned setup to `local.nix` file in nixpkgs root. Eg. to
add programs you develop on the local machine to i3 floating config, you could
have a `local.nix` like:

    { ... }:

    {
      xsession.windowManager.i3.config.floating.criteria =
        [ { "class" = "my-program-1"; } { "class" = "my-program-2"; } ];
    }
