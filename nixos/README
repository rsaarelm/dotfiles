# Setting up a new host

Make a `$(hostname)` subdirectory in `nixos/` for the new host. Move your
generated configuration.nix and hardware-configuration.nix there.

Run `./generate-configuration.sh` to generate the unversioned stub
`configuration.nix` for your machine.

# Setting up wifi

Copy `wifi.nix.example` into `wifi.nix` and add wifi PSKs. File `wifi.nix`
will not be version controlled.
